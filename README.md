# JavaScript Type Coercion in Arithmetic Operators
This example demonstrates the unexpected behavior of type coercion in JavaScript's addition operator (+).
When adding operands of different types, JavaScript attempts to coerce the operands to a common type before performing the addition.
This can lead to unexpected results if not handled carefully.
The `bug.js` file shows this unexpected behavior and the `bugSolution.js` file shows how to explicitly handle type conversions to prevent unexpected results.
